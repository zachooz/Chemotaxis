Chemotaxis
==========
Chemotaxis is when an organism moves toward or away from a chemical stimulus, like food. Biologists write software using random walks to model and study how very small organisms like bacteria search for food. In this assignment you will create a simulation of organisms moving away from a starting position using a random walk. This assignment is similar in some ways to the ticklish penguin, but is different in that you must create a class to represent the organisms. NOTE: you must use Math.random() for all the random numbers in this assignment. The random() function we used in processing last year is not part of the AP subset.
